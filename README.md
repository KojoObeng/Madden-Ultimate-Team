## What is Madden Ultimate Team?

Madden Ultimate Team is a popular mode in EA's Madden NFL video game series. Every NFL athlete has multiple cards of their themself, with their stats generally improving as the year progresses. Cards can be bought for in-game currency on the auction house, or real money, and then used to play against other players across the world. With hundreds of thousands of players and an thriving auction market, it is by far the game's most popular mode as players grind towards getting the best version of their favourite players of all-time and using them against their friends or other opponents online.
